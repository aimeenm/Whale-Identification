### Resources:
- https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html
- https://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/d88/tutorial_traincascade.html

### To Do List:
- Learn Basic OpenCV
- Be able to identify if a photo contains a whale tail (object detection)
- isolate the whale tail
- analyze that whale tail
- Find someone that knows what they are doing 
- Look up tutorials on computer vision
- Look up tutorials on computer image recognition
- Mudd data consulting??

## Goal: 
- At the very least: presentable algorithm, does not have to work all the time
  - above 30% accuracy
- Presention is important, but save for the end
- Understand basic ML concepts
- Become better at git
